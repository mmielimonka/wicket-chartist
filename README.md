Wicked Chartist
=============
Interactive Javascript charts wrapper for wicket web applications (https://wicket.apache.org/) 
based on chartist.js library (https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/).

What is Wicked Chartist?
======================
Wicked Chartist is a Java wrapper of the [Chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) javascript library. Chartist provides charts using HTML5 SVG technology. With Wicked Chartist, you can configure a chart in Java and display it in a web application based on Apache Wicket Framework.

How does it work?
=================
A complete Demo will follow soon.

Your web framework is not supported?
================================
If your Java-based framework of choice is not supported by Wicked Chartist, feel free to get in touch with us. It shouldn't be much work to get the basic features also working for your framework.

Want to contribute?
===================
Feel free to clone this repository and submit pull request. I will see to get them merged into the main project.

Maven coordinates

Actually the project is under construction.
After the first release there will be a maven dependency u can use for your project.
